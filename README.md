## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Pooja Ginjupalli and I'm a junior studying computer science at Stony Brook University! I'm also studying machine learning through Cornell's Break Through Tech AI (BTTAI) program.

Recently, I've worked on a few projects that I am proud of. Here's a brief description of my proudest one:

### Verizon Electricity Price Forecasting

Through BTTAI, I worked in a team of 5 women with Verizon to build a machine learning model to predict electricity prices by state and sector. We used technologies like Python and Google Colab and libraries like Scikit-Learn and Pandas to train and test an ARIMA model.
